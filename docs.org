* The Setup
We have a wooden platform with two blocks vertically mounted about 1 foot apart.
See pictures of setup:

* Wiring
The load cells need to have their output signal amplified, so we use two INA125P amplifiers to bring their signals up to a level that Arduino can work with.

* Arduino code set up
Print the mean of the two readings out to Serial, one reading per line.


* Calibration
Next, we needed to determine the relationship between the output of the load cells.
We could have done some math to find these relationships, but
To do this, we gathered a few household items of various weights and an electronic scale. We weighed each item and recorded its weight on a piece of paper.
